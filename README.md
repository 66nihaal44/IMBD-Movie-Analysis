# IMBD-Movie-Analysis
[Link to workbook](https://public.tableau.com/views/IMBD-Movie-Analysis/TrendsinMoviesoverTimeandGenre)<br>
Tableau workbook that breaks down trends in movie genres in terms of ratings and output.<br>
The workbook's objective is to examine how genre output has evolved over time and identify patterns in ratings. It depends upon a dataset that was cleaned and transformed in Python with pandas. The data was then analyzed with matplotlib and seaborn, and was finally made into visualizations in the Tableau workbook.<br>
## Data
Relies on the IMDb Movie Dataset: All Movies by Genre, licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajugc/imdb-movies-dataset-based-on-genre.<br> The original dataset is a series of .csv files, seperated by genre, containing 360,000+ rows of individual movie data in total. The movie_id, movie_name, year, rating, votes, and genre columns were chosen for analysis.
## Data Preparation
The files were united into one data chart.
