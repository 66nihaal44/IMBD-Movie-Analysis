# IMBD-Movie-Analysis
[Link to workbook](https://public.tableau.com/views/IMBD-Movie-Analysis/MovieOutputoverTime)<br>
Tableau workbook that breaks down trends in movie genres in terms of ratings and output.<br>
The workbook's objective is to examine how genre output has evolved over time and identify patterns in ratings. It depends upon a dataset that was cleaned and transformed in Python with pandas. The data was then analyzed with matplotlib and seaborn, and was finally made into visualizations in the Tableau workbook.<br>
